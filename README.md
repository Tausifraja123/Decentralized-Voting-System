# Decentralized Voting System

## Project Description

The Decentralized Voting System is a blockchain-based smart contract application built on Ethereum using Solidity. This system provides a transparent, secure, and tamper-proof voting mechanism where votes are recorded immutably on the blockchain. The contract eliminates the need for intermediaries and ensures complete transparency in the electoral process.

The system allows an election administrator to register voters, add candidates, manage voting periods, and tally results automatically. All voting data is stored on the blockchain, making it publicly verifiable while maintaining voter privacy through address-based identification.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to revolutionize the traditional voting system by leveraging blockchain technology to create a more democratic, transparent, and accessible electoral process. We aim to eliminate common issues in traditional voting such as:

- **Vote manipulation and fraud**
- **Lack of transparency in vote counting**
- **High administrative costs**
- **Limited accessibility for remote voters**
- **Slow result declaration**

By building this decentralized voting system, we envision a future where elections are conducted with complete integrity, where every vote is accurately counted, and where the democratic process is strengthened through technological innovation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Hardhat or Truffle framework
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Test Ether for deployment

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Compile the contract: `npx hardhat compile`
4. Deploy to testnet: `npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network-name>`
5. Interact with the contract through frontend or scripts

### Usage
1. Deploy the contract as the election administrator
2. Register eligible voters using `registerVoter()`
3. Add candidates using `addCandidate()`
4. Start voting with `startVoting(duration)`
5. Voters cast votes using `vote(candidateId)`
6. View results with `getResults()` after voting ends
